The goals of the Google Homepage project are the following:
1) Learn to use Git/GitHub for version control.
2) Learn to use HTML for webpage structuring.
3) Learn to use CSS for webpage styling.

This project was previously completed and is viewable under the google-homepage GitHub repository. The purpose of the homepage-refactor project (this one) was to write cleaner, more concise code.

TODO:
1) Add functional Google search
2) Add "I'm Feeling Lucky" functionality.
3) Drop down menus on hover for waffle and settings buttons.
